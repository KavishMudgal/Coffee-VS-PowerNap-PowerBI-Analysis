## Alertness Trends
- Power Naps produce a higher short-term alertness spike (approx. 60 minutes).
- The alertness level gradually declines after the peak.
- Coffee provides a more stable alertness curve lasting approximately 65–70 minutes.
- While the spike is lower than Power Naps, the sustained duration is slightly longer.


## Productivity Analysis
- Productivity levels vary based on sleep duration.
- Individuals with adequate sleep show more stable productivity regardless of intervention.
- Occupational differences influence the effectiveness of alertness recovery methods.

## Summary
| Factor         | Power Nap          | Coffee          |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Peak Alertness | Higher             | Moderate        |
| Duration       | Shorter            | Slightly Longer |
| Stability      | Declines Gradually | More Consistent |


## Conclusion
Power Naps provide stronger short-term recovery, whereas Coffee offers more sustained moderate alertness. However, baseline sleep remains a critical factor influencing productivity performance.
